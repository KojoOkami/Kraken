This is a school capstone project for my AP Computer Science Grade 12 course. Unfortunataly it was hit by Corona, so it is infested with bugs and barely functional.

## Description

A program that lets you express ideas for stories, worldbuilding, or any other similar ideas in a unique and free way.

The program acts as a network of flowcharts or spider webs, where each node can be a topic title or document with a microsoft word or google docs style document inside.
Each node can have children and parent nodes, which is how you can show connectings between documents.

## Planned - Didn't get implemenmted due to time restrictions

* Quoting/referencing other documents from within a document
* Buttons for text formatting
  * Similar to Microsoft Word or Google Docs formatting (Bold, Italics, Strikethrough, etc.)
  * Currently it uses HTML text formatting in documents
